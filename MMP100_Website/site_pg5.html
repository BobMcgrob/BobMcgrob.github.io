		<h1>Congratulations! You beat the game.</h1>
		<head> But you didn't. Not really. Because there isn't a game. <p>There, I admitted it.</p>
		<p>Its not in progress. Its not going to be done soon. There wont be any captivating storytelling, there wont be any secrets to unravel, there wont be any adventures to be had.</p>
		<p>I had...ideas, you know? I had grand visions of tales of dragons and knights, heroes and villains, gods and monsters...
		</p><p>I had a sprawling saga unfolding in my head. But when I tried to create it...</p>
		<p>There was never enough time, there was never enough quality, there was never enough-...there was never enough.</p>

		...I'm sorry. I can't do this. <a href="site_pg0.html">Just leave me alone</a>.</head>
